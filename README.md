# DescribeML ![GitHub tag (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/SOM-Research/DescribeML?label=Version&style=for-the-badge)

DescribeML is a VSCode language plugin to describe machine-learning datasets. <br>

Precisely describe your data's provenance, composition, and social concerns in a structured format.


Make it easy to **reproduce your experiments** to others when you cannot share your data. <br>
<br>
Check out the quick video [presentating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf3bhWB-UJY) of the tool, and the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Of1qfuJKvY) presented in the MODELS '22 Conference

## Installation 

### Via marketplace

The easiest way to install the plugin is by using the **Visual Studio Code Market**. Just type "describeML" in the extension tab, and that's it!

### Manually

Instead, you can install it manually using the packaged release of the plugin in this [repository](https://github.com/SOM-Research/DescribeML) that can be found at the root of the project. 

The file is **DescribeML-1.2.0.vsix**

Open your terminal (or the terminal inside the VSCode) and write this:

```

git clone https://github.com/SOM-Research/DescribeML.git datasets
cd datasets 
code --install-extension DescribeML-1.2.0.vsix
```

<span style="font-size:0.7em;">*Troubles: If you cannot see the syntax highlight in the examples files (p.e. *Melanoma.descml*) as the image below. Please, reload the VSCode editor and write the code --install command again* </span>

Great! That's it.



## Getting Started

1) The first step is to create a *.descml* file

2) The easy way to start using our tool is to use the *preloader data service*,  located at the top left of your editor, clicking at: <img
  src="https://github.com/SOM-Research/DescribeML/blob/main/fileicons/cloud-computing.png?raw=true"
  alt="preloader service"
  title="Optional title"
  style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; width: 40px">

3) Select your dataset file (*.csv*), and the tool will generate a draft of your description file.

4) To help you, look to the [Language Reference Guide](https://github.com/SOM-Research/DescribeML/blob/main/documentation/language-reference-guide.md) and follow the examples in the **examples/evaluation** [folders](https://github.com/SOM-Research/DescribeML/tree/main/examples/evaluation) to get a sense of the tool's possibilities. Take a look at the *Melanoma.descml* file, for example.
5) During the documentation process, hitting CTRL + Space (equivalent in other OS) gives you auto-completion help. In addition, the part marked with the points below gives you hints to complete the documentation, and the outline in the right part shows you the document structure.

6) Once you are happy with your documentation, you can generate HTML documentation by clicking the generator button next to the prealoder service: <img

  alt="HTML generator"
  title="Optional title"
  style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; width: 40px">

## Contributing

This project is being development as part of a research line of the [SOM Research Lab](https://som-research.github.io/), but we are open to contributions from the community. If you are interested in contributing to this project, please first read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines file.

### Repository structure

The following tree shows the list of the repository's relevant sections:

- The *documentation* and *examples* folders contains the mentioend examples and the language reference guide.
- The *out* folder contains the executable plugin in JS. You may not want to dive in as it is generated by the TypeScrpit compiler
- The *src* folder contains the project's source code
  - The *cli* folder is the generated grammar and AST from Langium. You may not want to dive in it as it is a generated asset
  - The *generator-service* folder contains all the code of the generation service. Could be a good place to start if you want to improve the generation of the tool.
  - The *uploader-service* folder contains all the code of the uploader service. Could be a good place to contribute new statistical metrics, or ML techniques to do dataset reverse engineering
  - The *language-server* folder contains all the language features, and the grammar declaration. If you want to improve the grammar, or some of the features the plugin offers here is the place you may want to start
    - The *dataset-description.langium* file contains the main grammar declaration. This grammar is developed using the [Langium Grammar Language](https://langium.org/docs/grammar-language/). Please refer to the linked documentation to more insights on how to develop the grammar.

#### Debugging the extensions

This repo comes with an already built-in config to debug. Just go to Debug in VSCode, and launch the Extension config. Please check your port 6009 is free.
  
For more information about how the framework works and how the language can be extended, please refer to https://github.com/langium/langium or the VSCode extension API documentation https://code.visualstudio.com/api

## Research background

DescribeML is part of an ongoing research project to improve dataset documentation for machine learning. The core of our proposal is a domain-specific language ([preprint here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361836238_A_domain-specific_language_for_describing_machine_learning_datasets)) that allows data creators to describe relevant aspects of their data for the machine learning field and beyond. The [Critical Dataset Studios](https://knowingmachines.org/reading-list#dataset_documentation_practices) of the [Knowing Machines](https://knowingmachines.org) project have compiled an excellent list of current documentation practices.

The tool has been presented at the ACM/IEEE 25th International Conference on [Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2022) and a preprint of the tool publication can be seen [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363256430_DescribeML_A_Tool_for_Describing_Machine_Learning_Datasets)
